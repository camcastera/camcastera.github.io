# Welcome
---------------------

I am an associate professor ("maître de conférences" in french) in optimization and machine learning at the [mathematical institute of the university of Bordeaux](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/imb/spip.php) (IMB).

From 2022 to 2024, I was a postdoc at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/mathematics/department/), working on the [TRINOM-DS](https://mop.math.uni-tuebingen.de/research/trinomDS/index.shtml) project led by [Peter Ochs](https://www.mop.uni-saarland.de/people/ochs/index.shtml) and [Jalal Fadili](https://fadili.users.greyc.fr/). Prior to that, I wrote my PhD thesis (available [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04186508)) at the [IRIT](https://www.irit.fr/) laboratory in Toulouse (supervised by [Cédric Févotte](https://www.irit.fr/~Cedric.Fevotte/), [Edouard Pauwels](https://www.tse-fr.eu/people/edouard-pauwels) and [Jérôme Bolte](https://www.tse-fr.eu/fr/people/jerome-bolte/)). I was a member of the [FACTORY](http://projectfactory.irit.fr/) project.

My research focuses on optimization algorithms for machine learning (mainly second-order methods with application to deep learning), and [learning optimization algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18222).
